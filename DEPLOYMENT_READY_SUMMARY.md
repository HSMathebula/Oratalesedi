## 📋 Before You Deploy - Action Items

### Step 1: Set Up Email Service (REQUIRED)
You must configure email to enable contact and quote forms:

1. **Sign up for Brevo (Recommended - Free tier available)**
   - Visit: https://www.brevo.com
   - Create account and get SMTP credentials
   
   OR
   
2. **Use Gmail (Alternative)**
   - Enable 2-Factor Authentication
   - Generate App Password
   - Use SMTP settings from `env.example`

### Step 2: Create Environment Variables
On your Hostinger server, create `.env.local` with:

```bash
SMTP_SERVER=smtp-relay.brevo.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_LOGIN=your-email@example.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-password
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Step 3: Follow Deployment Guide
Open and follow **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** for complete instructions.

## 🔧 Project Configuration

### Build Settings (next.config.mjs)
```javascript
{
  eslint: { ignoreDuringBuilds: true },
  typescript: { ignoreBuildErrors: true },
  images: { unoptimized: true }
}
```

### Start Script
The project includes `scripts/start.js` which automatically:
- Detects Hostinger's PORT environment variable
- Starts Next.js on the correct port
- Works cross-platform (Windows/Linux)

### Package Scripts
```json
{
  "build": "next build",       // Build for production
  "dev": "next dev",           // Development server
  "start": "node ./scripts/start.js",  // Production start
  "lint": "next lint"          // Code linting
}
```
